# Changelog

## Ideabox

Unreleased and unplanned todos

- [ ] Consider detecting the User's config dir, and storing tools there, vs having a `~/.frey`
- [ ] Consider only source `*.frey.toml` files, or using imports, so that random `*.toml` like Rust's `Cargo.toml` isn't merged in.
- [ ] Ditch yargs for mimimist, now that we can have autocomplete via liftoff already
- [ ] Empty out and remove `Base` class?
- [ ] Figure out local Pip installs so we can build on Travis `sudo: false` platform
- [ ] Implement commit: Safely commit state automatically
- [ ] Indent stdout/err
- [ ] Mocha tests for `App`
- [ ] Mocha tests for `Shell`
- [ ] Mocha tests for `Base`
- [ ] Remote state in S3 feature
- [ ] Use Terraform modules similar to Ansible roles: https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html
- [ ] Vagrant support
- [ ] website: Console window like http://lebab.io/? Here's another: http://codepen.io/peiche/details/LNVYzJ/
- [ ] Equal sign vertical alignment for `frey format`
- [ ] website: pitch: "don't hide away infra in obscure documentation, repos, datacenters, support desks. Evolve it together with your app"
- [ ] docs: since node is installed on Every Travis image, you can easily deploy go projects with frey http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31235146/how-to-run-node-js-and-ruby-tests-within-one-project-on-travis-ci
- [ ] docs: env secrets on Travis are not exposed to PRs from other repos: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests
- [ ] Add generic cleanup method that `.pem` as well as `Frey-residu-*` can be registered with, so it will all be deleted if `global.purge_residu` is turned on (default = `true`)

## v0.3.20 (Unreleased)

- [ ] allow Ansible and Terraform version override from config
- [ ] Check for `git ignore Frey-residu-*`
- [ ] Offer cast5 encryption and decryption for `env.sh` (then remove `rebuild-env.sh` script from dependents)
- [ ] `Show` should use `terraformInventory` just like `Remote`, instead of `public_addresses`
- [ ] Speed up prepare by writing hashses do disk and comparing (just like depmake does)
- [ ] Deprecate dual pyhcl usage now that we verified 0.2.1 solves all troubles
- [ ] Symlink ansible if needed: `mkdir -p ~/.frey/tools/ansible/2.0.1.0/pip/bin/ && ln -nfs ~/.frey/tools/ansible/2.0.1.0/usr/local/share/python/ansible ~/.frey/tools/ansible/2.0.1.0/pip/bin/ansible && ln -nfs ~/.frey/tools/ansible/2.0.1.0/usr/local/share/python/ansible-playbook ~/.frey/tools/ansible/2.0.1.0/pip/bin/ansible-playbook`

## v0.3.1 (2016-02-19)

- [x] Implement install
- [x] Signify chained via â–½
- [x] Use FREY_TARGETS or swap out terraformInventory, to target localhost on Travis and some Vagrant box on OSX with `install`

- [x] Use flatten in utils.render. Then we can replace `{{{self.version}}}` as well as `{{{options.foobar}}}`
- [x] Tools should be saved under version number only. This way different versions of frey can use their own tested tools, while also still being able to share between same frey installs
- [x] Upgrade Terraform 
- [x] Upgrade Terraform-inventory 
- [x] Upgrade Ansible 
- [x] Replace mustache with lodash templating
- [x] Put `_transform` in a central place (utils?)
- [x] New command: `frey compile` that's prefixed to any chain, so you can trust your updates are present in residu, and have its configuration available too (ssh user for instance)
- [x] Merge chain & commands
- [x] A project's package.json should refer to a frey version, which should be used, vs the global one.
- [x] Ansible must run from configBase
- [-] If you do a `frey install` you must trust that at least the Ansible files are re-compiled
- [-] Re-introduce `init` for local prepare. Such as converting Freyfile to residu. Should be prefixed to chain of commands. Then a single install can benefit from it (remove the `refresh` from that acceptance test) and validation can be ran against it/them
- [x] Frey should traverse cwd upwards until it finds a Freyfile, and use that as default project dir
- [x] Switch to local npm install if available via LiftOff
- [x] Consider storing residu files in ~/.frey/tmp/
- [x] Default appname should be basename of dirname of Freyfile, not pwd
- [x] replace IPs and UUIDs, it's possible to disable SKIP_COMPARE_STDIO on the openstack acceptace test
- [x] Enable Openstack support after https://github.com/adammck/terraform-inventory/issues/14
- [x] Coveralls

- [x] Patch up toml -> json
- [x] Pave way to meaningful output without DEBUG
- [x] Prompt "Dare I install"? With --force-yes override

- [x] Linux workstation support (Travis ;))
- [x] tooldir should be coupled with global Frey install and not per-project
- [-] /command/module/ 
- [-] Class.run becomes Class.main. The new run is Base.run. Which does a waterfall of @boot[], then @main
- [x] Test & document --no-colors
- [x] Implement a bailAfter, use it for DynamoDB scenario
- [x] Amazon free tier dynamodb Travis tests 
- [x] Runtime can be a command module, which can be prefixed to the runChain. Prepare can also be prepended to all. Afterwards, scenarios won't need to be ordered
- [x] `./Freyfile.toml` ? This means projectdir defaults to `.`, and .git check should traverse upwards 'indefinitely'
- [x] Move validation to Validate class
- [x] Port Prepare SSH Keys
- [x] Port refresh
- [x] Port plan
- [x] Port launch
- [x] Port backup
- [x] Series/waterfall combination for boot 
- [x] Pass {} to first boot function. Use @options like all other methods to avoid confusion
- [x] Add (script to add) more encrypted cloud keys
- [x] exeScript should become exe. new exeScript prepends bash -o
- [x] Rename integration to acceptance (test) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing
